So React developer tool warned me against using `target='_blank'` without `rel='noopener noreferrer'` 
in my react app due to security reasons.
Essentially, adding `rel='noopener noreferrer'` to links protects your site's users against having the site you've linked to potentially hijacking the browser.
Adding it to your external link that's having `target='_blank'` fixies the vulnerability in all major browser.

The syntax of the api is written in Javascript.

<!-- Code Blocks -->
```html

    <a href="https://testing-link.com target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'" 

```

Both **noopener** and **noreferrer** serves thesame purpose, but as some browsers
will only accepts either one or the other.

Thanks for reading!!!
